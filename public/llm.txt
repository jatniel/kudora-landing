technical_notes:
  chain_id_format:
    explanation: >
      The chain ID format 'kudora_12000-1' follows the EIP155 pattern
      (name_evm-chain-id-version), suggesting potential EVM compatibility
      or preparation for EVM module integration.
    evm_chain_id: "12000"
    cosmos_version_suffix: "1"

  slip44_significance:
    coin_type: 60
    explanation: >
      Slip44 coin type 60 is Ethereum's standard. This choice indicates
      Kudora's alignment with Ethereum tooling and wallet infrastructure,
      enabling compatibility with MetaMask and other Ethereum wallets.

  ethsecp256k1_advantages:
    - "Single wallet for both Cosmos and Ethereum interactions"
    - "Lower friction for Ethereum developers entering Cosmos"
    - "Broader wallet ecosystem support"
    - "Familiar key management for Ethereum users"
    - "Potential for cross-chain signature verification"

  potential_evm_features:
    status: ""
    possibilities:
      - "Full EVM execution environment (like Evmos/Cronos)"
      - "EVM precompiles for specific functionality"
      - "Future EVM integration planned"
      - "EVM-compatible tooling without full EVM runtime"
    important_note: >
      The combination of kudora_12000-1 chain ID format, Slip44 type 60,
      and ethsecp256k1 strongly suggests EVM-related features either
      currently implemented or planned for future releases. This should be
      clarified in documentation as it's a major differentiator.
